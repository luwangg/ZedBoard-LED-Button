# ZedBoard LED

## About

This goal of this project was to implement a simple design on the [ZedBoard][ZedBoard Product Page]
PL as well as become more familiar with the [Xilinx Vivado Design Suite][Xilinx Vivado Design Suite].
The implemented design maps two buttons on the development board to two corresponding LEDs; 
pressing the button(s) illuminates the appropriate LED(s).
